Improve training data collection pipeline:
TODO: Setup multiple cameras to work with non-interupt based loop
TODO: Create general purpose script for recording and saving task data
TODO: Script to collect data for a given task and collect into a single zarr
    - Dataset (zarr) contains:
        - For each video stream, a single vector of video frames
        - Vector of servo positions with same indexing as video arrays
        - Vector of actions (next sero position) with same indexing as video arrays
        - Vector of episode lengths

Improve training pipeline:
TODO: Make dataset class and loader for pusht
TODO: Make script for training pusht task
TODO: Make modules for diffusion network models
TODO: Make general purpose script for training different tasks

Learning:
TODO: Find out what EMA is doing and how its implemented -> it's ~ a moving averge of model weights at training
